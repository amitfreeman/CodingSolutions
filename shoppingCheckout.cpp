/*
Here is the Question for the coding exercise:

Step1: Shopping Cart
- You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
- Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
- Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost.
- For example [Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple] => Â£2.05
- Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input

Step2: Simple offers:
- The shop decides to introduce 2 new offers
- buy one, get one free on Apples
- 3 for the price of 2 on oranges
- Update your checkout functions accordingly
